Summer of Code 2007 - Improve test coverage of Python 2.6 standard library

Abstract: There are several modules in the Python standard library which 
either have no dedicated test suites, or have tests that cover significantly 
less than 100% of the module code. I propose to improve the test coverage of 
the Python standard library by implementing new tests for at least four 
modules with little or no existing coverage.

Results:
    1 new patch, with 17 new tests in total

    Coverage improvement:
        Module                  Original        Final
        ==================      ========        =====
        xmlrpclib               60%             64%

Patch #1 (patch1.diff): 17 new xmlrpclib tests, 134 new LoC

    Added tests for basic behavior of DateTime, Binary, and Fault classes and
    the escape function. Check that marshalling recursive sequences & dicts 
    raises TypeError. Check that marshalling out-of-range ints raises 
    OverflowError.

    Status: Pending
