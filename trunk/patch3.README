Patch note for patch3.diff

New tests for basic behavior of smtplib.SMTP and smtpd.DebuggingServer. Change to use global host & port number variables. Modified the 'server' to take a string to send back in order to vary test server responses. Added a test for the reaction of smtplib.SMTP to a non-200 HELO response.
