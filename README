Summer of Code 2007 - Improve test coverage of Python 2.6 standard library

Abstract: There are several modules in the Python standard library which 
either have no dedicated test suites, or have tests that cover significantly 
less than 100% of the module code. I propose to improve the test coverage of 
the Python standard library by implementing new tests for at least four 
modules with little or no existing coverage.

Results:
    3 new patches, with ?? new tests in total

    Coverage improvement:
        Module                  Original        Final
        ==================      ========        =====
        xmlrpclib               60%             
        SimpleXMLRPCServer      19%             
        asyncore                42%             
        asynchat                70%             
        smtplib                 34%             
        smtpd                   14%             
        

Patch #1 (patch1.diff): 17 new xmlrpclib tests, 134 new LoC

    Added tests for basic behavior of DateTime, Binary, and Fault classes and
    the escape function. Check that marshalling recursive sequences & dicts 
    raises TypeError. Check that marshalling out-of-range ints raises 
    OverflowError.

    Status: Pending

Patch #2 (patch2.diff): 14 new asyncore tests, 370 new LoC

    Added test_asyncore.py. Includes tests for helper functions: read, write, 
    _exception, readwrite, closeall, compact_traceback; and for classes
    dispatcher, dispatcher_with_send, and file_wrapper.

    Status: Pending

Patch #3 (patch3.diff): ?? new smtplib tests, ?? new LoC

    New tests for test_smtplib.py. Includes tests for smtpd.DebuggingServer, 
    and for the reaction of smtplib classes to invalid responses from the 
    SMTP server.

    Status: In progress
